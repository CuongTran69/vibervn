# Proposal: Coming Soon Tools Full Detail Cards

## Problem
AmpCode and Antigravity are shown as minimal "coming soon" badges at the bottom of the tools section. They lack detail and don't give users any useful information about what these tools offer.

## Solution
Upgrade AmpCode and Antigravity to full detail cards (same layout as available tools) but in a visually disabled/waiting state:
- Full descriptions, taglines, strengths, bestFor, products
- Homepage URL links (↗) that work
- "COMING SOON" badge instead of "SUPPORTED"
- Visually greyed out (reduced opacity, dashed border)
- No gateway CTA button (since they're not available yet)

## URLs
- AmpCode: https://ampcode.com/
- Antigravity: https://antigravity.google/

## Impact
- Small change: data + UI only
- No new pages, no new components
- No breaking changes
